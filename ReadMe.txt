The file can be extracted from RStudio or locally extract from which it is saved.

CodeBook.md describes the variables, data and the process on which the datasets undergone.

The "run_analysis.R" provides to step-by-step process of extracting, merging and calculating the necessary requirements
from the datasets.

"plyr" plugin is installed to read/process the files.

"training_avg_data.txt" is the outcome of the analysis.
